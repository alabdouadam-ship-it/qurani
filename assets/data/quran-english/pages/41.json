The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands.\" And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: \"We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: \"Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere).\"",
